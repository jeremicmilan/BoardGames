The object of the game is to own more pieces than your opponent when the game is over. The game is over when neither player has a move. Usually, this means the board is full. You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color. For example, suppose you are White, and there is a row of black pieces with one white piece on its end. You can place a white piece on the other end of the black row and capture the black pieces. You can capture vertical, horizontal, and diagonal rows of pieces. Also, you can capture more than one row at once.
