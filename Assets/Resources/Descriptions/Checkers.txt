The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's checkers or position your pieces so that your opponent has no available moves. Basic movement is to move a checker one space diagonally forward. You can not move a checker backwards until it becomes a King, if a jump is available, you must take the jump. If one of your opponent's checkers is on a forward diagonal next to one of your checkers, and the next space beyond the opponent's checker is empty, then your checker must jump the opponent's checker and land in the space beyond. Your opponent's checker is captured and removed from the board. After making one jump, your checker might have another jump available from its new position which you must also take. When one of your checkers reaches the opposite side of the board, it is crowned and becomes a King.
