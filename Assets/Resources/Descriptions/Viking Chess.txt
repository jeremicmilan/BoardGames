The white has a king and 8 pawns, the black has 16 pawns. The centre square is called The Castle and the 4 squares that form a T-shaped camp are called Base Camp squares. The pieces are arranged as shown on the picture. The white king is placed in the castle surrounded by his 8 soldiers, two in each direction, black are placed in the base camps, four in each camp. All pieces move like the rook in chess, that is horizontally and vertically. A hostile piece is captured by placing two of one's own pieces on opposite sides of it and removed from the board. A player may move a piece in between two enemy soldiers without being captured. The king cannot be captured but must be surrounded on all four sides. If the black succeeds in this, they have won the game. White wins the game if the king has an open way out from the board, which the black cannot block.
