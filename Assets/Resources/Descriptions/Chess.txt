Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape from capture. Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. The king can only move one square in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. The queen can move in any one straight direction forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally. The rook may move forward, backward, and to the sides. The bishop may move only diagonally. Knights move going two squares in one direction, and then one more at a 90 degree angle. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their first move where they can move forward two squares. Pawns capture in different ways: they move forward, but capture diagonally.
