As in Checkers, only the dark squares are used. The four hounds (black) are initially placed on the dark squares at one edge of the board. The fox (white) is placed on a random dark square on the opposite edge. The objective of the fox is to cross from one side of the board to the other, arriving at any one of the hounds original squares. The hounds objective is to prevent it from doing so. The fox is trapped when it can no longer move to a vacant square. The hounds move like a checkers pawns, diagonally forward one square. The fox moves like a checkers king, diagonally forward or backward one square. However there is no jumping, promotion, or removal of pieces. The play alternates with the fox moving first. The player controlling the hounds may move only one of them each turn.
